Project built using Kotlin and gradle

## Instructions to run
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run the gradlew file and pass run command in terminal
   * ex: ```./gradlew run```

## Development Plan
1. Analysis and research
	1. Analyze the document required to be read for possible start & end points
	2. Research ways to strip HTML markup from text
	3. Research how to separate individual words from each line being read
	4. Research how to strip punctuation from words

2. Process Planning
	1. Define what the UX should be like (what will the user see)
	2. Establish a rough flow for what the process of loading the document, reading it, when to start counting word occurrences and when to stop
	3. Defining what method works best to store data and how to best present the data

3. Build/Test
	1. Start by building and testing each small piece individually (For example, build the way to get the doc and read the lines and print to the console to ensure we are able to read it all)
	2. Try connecting a couple pieces at a time (For example, connect the reading of the doc to the part where we try to find the start of the poem)
	3. Test each connection by printing results to ensure correct outcomes
	4. Once all the pieces are connected, test the program end to end.
	5. Correct any process errors to ensure all loops and checks are working as desired

4. Polish
	1. Once all issues are fixed, add comments
	2. Refine the ux to ensure interface is easy to read/understand
	3. Add error handling to ensure edge cases are taken care of

5. Turn in Project
